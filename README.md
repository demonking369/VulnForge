# VulnForge

An AI-powered vulnerability research framework for authorized security testing and bug bounty hunting.

## Key Enhancements

- **ðŸ§  Advanced AI Pipeline:** VulnForge now features a sophisticated, multi-step AI reasoning engine. By chaining specialized prompts inspired by leading AI agents like Devin and Manus, the system can autonomously plan, execute, and analyze complex security tasks from start to finish.
- **âš¡ Polyglot Performance Architecture:** The framework has been re-engineered to use the best language for the job, resulting in significant speed and efficiency gains.
  - **Python:** For high-level orchestration and `asyncio` management.
  - **C/C++ & Rust:** For performance-critical tasks like high-speed data parsing and native OS interaction.
  - **Assembly:** For fine-grained, "close-to-the-metal" optimizations.
- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Screen Control:** A complete, multi-language module that allows the AI to see and interact with the desktop environment like a human, enabling a new class of automated tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/demonking369/VulnForge.git
   cd VulnForge
   ```

2. **Build Native Modules:** Compile the high-performance C/Rust modules required for advanced features.
   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install_script.sh
   ```

4. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-test.txt  # For development
   ```

5. Install Required Tools:
   - Ensure the following tools are installed and in your `PATH`:
     - `nmap`
     - `subfinder`
     - `httpx`
     - `nuclei`
     - `gobuster`
     - `ffuf`
     - `whatweb`
     - `dig`
   - For tools installed via Go (like `nuclei`), ensure `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH` or move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`.

6. **Ollama Setup:**
   - VulnForge uses Ollama for model serving to optimize resource utilization
   - Ensure Ollama is installed and running on your system
   - The main model used is `deepseek-coder`, with `mistral` serving as the assistant model
   - Models are automatically downloaded on first run

   **AI Models Used:**
   - **Primary Model**: `deepseek-coder-v2:16b-lite-base-q4_0`
     - 16B parameter model optimized for code understanding and generation
     - Used for code generation, analysis, and security tasks
     - Quantized for efficient resource usage
   - **Assistant Model**: `mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q4_0`
     - 7B parameter model based on Mistral architecture
     - Used for general queries and security guidance
     - Provides context-aware responses and tool recommendations

## Usage

### **NEW: Advanced AI Pipeline Mode**
Engage the most powerful mode where the AI plans and executes complex tasks autonomously.
```bash
vulnforge --target "Perform a full security assessment of example.com" --ai-pipeline
```

### Basic Reconnaissance
```bash
vulnforge -t example.com -m recon
```

### AI-Autonomous Mode
```bash
vulnforge -t example.com --ai-only
```
This mode enables the AI to:
- Automatically select and install required tools
- Make decisions about which modules to activate
- Sequence attacks based on findings
- Adapt to resistance and try alternate approaches
- Generate comprehensive reports

### Ask AI Questions
```bash
vulnforge ask-ai "What should I do if port 8080 is open?"
```
Options:
- `--verbose`: Show detailed model logs and prompts
- `--dangerous`: Enable dangerous mode (requires `--confirm-danger`)

### Development Mode
```bash
vulnforge --dev-mode
```
Available commands:
- `analyze <module>`: Analyze a module for improvements
- `modify <module> <changes>`: Apply changes to a module
- `list`: Show modification history
- `help`: Show available commands
- `exit`: Exit dev mode

### Tool Management
```bash
# Check and install tools
vulnforge --check

# List custom tools
vulnforge list-tools

# Generate custom tool
vulnforge generate-tool "DNS tunnel for exfiltration"
```

### Debug AI Decisions
```bash
vulnforge -t example.com --ai-only --ai-debug
```
This will show detailed AI reasoning and decision-making process.
